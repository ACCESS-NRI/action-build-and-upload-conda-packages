If a repository contains a meta.yaml file to build conda packages, the process of building and
uploading packages to an Anaconda user or organization is automatized by this GitHub Action. The user has only to be sure that the repository [have access to the corresponding Anaconda token](#Requirements).

In summary, this GitHub Action does the following:

- It is suggested that the action is triggered by a release or a prerelease publication.
- The action checks if the meta.yaml file exists in the directory specified by the user.
- It compiles then the list of packages to the platform and Python version specified by the user.
- Finally, the action uploads all packages built to the Anaconda user or organization specified by the user, with the label
  specified by the user (the option `auto` sets the value of the label as 'main' for releases and 'dev' to prereleases).

This GitHub Action was developed by [the Computational Biology and Drug Design Research Unit -UIBCDF- at the
Mexico City Children's Hospital Federico GÃ³mez](https://www.uibcdf.org/). Other GitHub Actions can
be found at [the UIBCDF GitHub site](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Agithub-actions+org%3Auibcdf&type=Repositories).

## Requirements

In addition to define the workflow to use this action in the '.github/workflow' directory of your
repository. There are three things you have to solve: having an Anaconda token to authorize the
access to your conda repository or organization, using Git tags as package version numbers in the metadata file with the conda build instructions, and a Yaml file to create a conda environment to
work with conda-build.

### Anaconda token as GitHub secret

In order to upload a package to your anaconda user or organization, you have to define an Anaconda API token. There are two ways you can easily do it. From the command line you can execute:

```bash
# In case of uploading to a user profile
# Replace 'MyToken' with the name you want for your token
TOKEN=$(anaconda auth --create --name MyToken)
```

or 

```bash
# Replace 'MyToken' with the name you want for your token
# Replace 'MyOrg' with the name of your organization
TOKEN=$(anaconda auth --create --name MyToken --org MyOrg)
```

After that, You can access to the value of your token:

```bash
echo $TOKEN
```

There is another way to create and manage your tokens. You can do it with the web page of your
Anaconda user or organization. In that page, the menu entrie 'Settings--> Access' shows the following form:

<br>
<center>
<img src="create_token.png" width="60%">
</center>
<br>

In this form mark the option 'Allow write access to the API site', choose a name and an expiration date
for your new token, and click 'Create'. Below this form, you will find the list of your tokens to
view their value or remove them.

Now, the last step. The repository where you want to include this GitHub Action has to have access,
quietly, to the value of this token. But you have to protect it, including the token string
explictly in the workflow is far from being a good idea. To solve this problem, GitHub includes for
your GitHub repositories or organizations, the possibility to store
['encrypted secrets'](https://github.blog/2021-04-13-implementing-least-privilege-for-secrets-in-github-actions/). [You can find documentation about it in the GitHub docs site](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets). Let's see here how to store the Anaconda token accesible for any public repository of an organization. Look for the section 'Settings -> Secrets' in the organization main web page in GitHub and click on the button 'New organization scret'. Briefly, choose a new name -this way for the variable storing the token value in GitHub- and copy the value of your token (a long string of "random" characters). As you can see in the secret creation form, you can give access to all public repositories in the organization or just a selected set of them (also to your private ones depending on your plan).

After all this process, **what matters to use this GitHub Action is the name of the secret with the
Anaconda token value**.

### Git Tag as package version

The instructions to build the new conda packages are defined by means of a YAML file usually named
'meta.yaml'. It is your work having this file well implemented. [Here you can find a guide to decide
the building parameters in this file](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html).

In this metadata file, the conda-build recipe includes setting the version number of the new
package. To avoid adding it manually and to use the release or prerelease GitHub tags as version label, use `{{ environ['GIT_DESCRIBE_TAG'] }}` in the `package: version:` field of the 'meta.yaml' file. Then, the first lines or your 'meta.yaml' file should look like this:

```yaml
package:
  name: package_name # write your library name
  version: "{{ environ['GIT_DESCRIBE_TAG'] }}"

source:
  path: ../../

build:
  number: 1
```

[Remember that version numbers including the dash character "-" are not supported by conda-build](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#package-version) as package versions. If you want to release a version like "1.0.0-beta.1", replace it with something like "1.0.0b1". Check [PEPE-86 verlib conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0386/) for further details.

### A Yaml file to create a conda environment to work with conda-build

Building your conda packages requires dependencies that can be solved with a
temporary conda environment. You already know that the list of dependencies of your library are specified in [your 'meta.yaml' file with the compilation instructions](), but the required channels needed to find them need to be provided. In the case of this GitHub Action, these channels are taken from the Yaml file with the details to execute the packages compilation (see the section ["Documentation conda environment"](#Documentation-conda-environment)). This Yaml file will look like:

```yaml
channels:    # write here the list of channels to look for your library dependencies
  - uibcdf
  - conda-forge
  - default

dependencies:   # Keep this block with only these two packages
  - anaconda-client
  - conda-build
```


## How to use it

To include this GitHub Action, put a Yaml file (named 'build\_and\_upload\_conda\_packages.yaml', for instance) with the following content in the
directory '.github/workflows' of your repository:

```yaml

name: Build and upload conda packages

on:
  release:
    types: ['released', 'prereleased']

# workflow_dispatch:        # Un comment line if you also want to trigger action manually

jobs:
  conda_deployment_with_new_tag:
    name: Conda deployment of package with Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10"]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Conda environment creation and activation
        uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
          environment-file: devtools/conda-envs/build_env.yaml    # Path to the build conda environment
          auto-update-conda: false
          auto-activate-base: false
          show-channel-urls: true
      - name: Build and upload the conda packages
        uses: uibcdf/action-build-and-upload-conda-packages@v1.2.0
        with:
          meta_yaml_dir: devtools/conda-build
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }} # Values previously defined in `matrix`
          platform_linux-64: true
          platform_osx-64: true
          platform_win-64: true
          user: uibcdf
          label: auto
          token: ${{ secrets.ANACONDA_TOKEN }} # Replace with the right name of your secret
```

#### Host platform package and conversion to other platforms

When the package is built from a pure python library, [`conda convert` can produce packages for a
long list of platforms](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs-skeleton.html?highlight=platform#optional-converting-conda-package-for-other-platforms). Instead, if you have to build a package that contains compiled code, `conda
convert` does not work and just the platform of the host machine will be built. In this former
case, if you want to produce packages for instance for 'linux-64', 'osx-64' and 'win-64, use
something like the following:

```yaml

name: Build and upload conda packages

on:
  release:
    types: ['released', 'prereleased']

# workflow_dispatch:        # Un comment line if you also want to trigger action manually

jobs:
  conda_deployment_with_new_tag:
    name: Conda deployment of package for platform ${{ matrix.os }} with Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [macOS-latest, ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
        python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10"]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Conda environment creation and activation
        uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
          environment-file: devtools/conda-envs/build_env.yaml    # Path to the build conda environment
          auto-update-conda: false
          auto-activate-base: false
          show-channel-urls: true
      - name: Build and upload the conda packages
        uses: uibcdf/action-build-and-upload-conda-packages@v1.2.0
        with:
          meta_yaml_dir: devtools/conda-build
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }} # Values previously defined in `matrix`
          user: uibcdf
          label: auto
          token: ${{ secrets.ANACONDA_TOKEN }} # Replace with the right name of your secret
```


### Input parameters

These are the input parameters of the action:

| Input parameters | Description | Required | Default value | 
| ---------------- | ----------- | -------- | ------------- |
| meta\_yaml\_dir | Path to the directory where the meta.yaml file with building instructions is located  | Yes |  |
| python-version | Python version of the built packages | Yes |  |
| platform\_host | Build packages for the host platform | No | True |
| platform\_all | Build packages for all supported platforms  | No | False |
| platform\_linux-64 | Build a package for the platform: linux-64 | No | False |
| platform\_linux-32 | Build a package for the platform: linux-32 | No | False |
| platform\_osx-64 | Build a package for the platform: osx-64 | No | False |
| platform\_osx-arm64 | Build a package for the platform: osx-arm64 | No | False |
| platform\_linux-ppc64 | Build a package for the platform: linux-ppc64 | No | False |
| platform\_linux-ppc64le | Build a package for the platform: linux-ppc64le | No | False |
| platform\_linux-s390x | Build a package for the platform: linux-s390x | No | False |
| platform\_linux-armv6l | Build a package for the platform: linux-armv6l | No | False |
| platform\_linux-armv7l | Build a package for the platform: linux-armv7l | No | False |
| platform\_linux-aarch64 | Build a package for the platform: linux-aarch64 | No | False |
| platform\_win-32 | Build a package for the platform: linux-win-32 | No | False |
| platform\_win-64 | Build a package for the platform: linux-win-64 | No | False |
| upload | Upload the built package to Anaconda. Setting to False is useful to test build correctness in CI | No | True |
| overwrite |  Do not cancel the uploading if a package with the same name is found already in Anaconda | No | False |
| user | User or organization name to upload packages to on anaconda.org | True |  |
| label | Name of the label to upload the package ('main', 'dev', ...). If the value is equal to 'auto', the action will automatically label releases as 'main' and prereleases as 'dev' | True | auto |
| token | Anaconda token to authorize the uploading (more info [here](#Anaconda-token-as-GitHub-secret)) | Yes |  |

They are placed in the `with:` subsection of the step named `Build and upload the conda packages` of the above workflow example file:

```yaml
      - name: Build and upload the conda packages
        uses: uibcdf/action-build-and-upload-conda-packages@v1.2.0
        with:
          meta_yaml_dir: devtools/conda-build
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }} # Values previously defined in `matrix`
          platform_linux-64: true
          platform_osx-64: true
          platform_win-64: true
          channel: uibcdf
          label: dev
          token: ${{ secrets.ANACONDA_TOKEN }}
```

At this point, you can probably wonder: but the python version of the package is specified in the
'meta.yaml' file, isn't it?

#### `python_version`

To define the python versions of the packages created by the GitHub Action you should use the input
parameter of [the workflow](#How-to-use-it) named `strategy: matrix: python-version`.

```yaml
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10"]
```

No matter the python version found in the 'meta.yaml' file, this action will make all the work to
convert the building instructions to the python versions you specify in your GitHub workflow.

### Testing build correctness

Typically this workflow is called in a deployment step, e.g. after a pull-request has succeeded and a new tag is added to the repository, or when a release is created. This means deployment generally occurs without checking if any errors to the build process were introduced in a pull request or code change.

To address this the `upload` option is provided. Setting `upload: false` will run all the steps in the workflow except uploading to Anaconda, and this can be done in a CI workflow to test build correctness, and catch errors during the pull-request process.

For example, this is an equivalent CI workflow for the deployment workflow above:

```yaml
name: Test Build of conda packages

# Controls when the action will run.
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  conda_deployment_with_new_tag:
    name: Test conda deployment of package with Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10"]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Conda environment creation and activation
        uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
          environment-file: devtools/conda-envs/build_env.yaml    # Path to the build conda environment
          auto-update-conda: false
          auto-activate-base: false
          show-channel-urls: true
      - name: Build but do not upload the conda packages
        uses: uibcdf/action-build-and-upload-conda-packages@v1.2.0
        with:
          meta_yaml_dir: devtools/conda-build
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }} # Values previously defined in `matrix`
          platform_linux-64: true
          platform_osx-64: true
          platform_win-64: true
          user: uibcdf
          label: auto
          upload: false
          token: ${{ secrets.ANACONDA_TOKEN }} # Replace with the right name of your secret
```
