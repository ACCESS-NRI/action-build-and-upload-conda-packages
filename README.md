If a repository contains a meta.yaml file to build conda packages, the process of building and
uploading packages to an Anaconda user or organization is automatized by this GitHub Action. The user has only to be sure that the repository [have access to the corresponding Anaconda token](#Requirements).

In summary, this GitHub Action does the following:

- It is suggested that the action is triggered by a release or a prerelease publication.
- The action checks if the meta.yaml file exists in the directory specified by the user.
- It compiles then the list of packages to the platform and Python version specified by the user.
- Finally, the action uploads all packages built to the Anaconda user or organization specified by the user, with the label
  specified by the user (the option `auto` sets the value of the label as 'main' for releases and 'dev' to prereleases).

This GitHub Action was developed by [the Computational Biology and Drug Design Research Unit -UIBCDF- at the
Mexico City Children's Hospital Federico GÃ³mez](https://www.uibcdf.org/). Other GitHub Actions can
be found at [the UIBCDF GitHub site](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Agithub-actions+org%3Auibcdf&type=Repositories).

## Requirements

In addition to define the workflow to use this action in the '.github/workflow' directory of your
repository. There is a thing you have to solve: an Anaconda token to authorize the
access to your conda repository or organization.

### Anaconda token as GitHub secret

In order to upload a package to your anaconda user or organization, you have to define an Anaconda API token. There are two ways you can easily do it. From the command line you can execute:

```bash
# In case of uploading to a user profile
# Replace 'MyToken' with the name you want for your token
TOKEN=$(anaconda auth --create --name MyToken)
```

or 

```bash
# Replace 'MyToken' with the name you want for your token
# Replace 'MyOrg' with the name of your organization
TOKEN=$(anaconda auth --create --name MyToken --org MyOrg)
```

After that, You can access to the value of your token:

```bash
echo $TOKEN
```

There is another way to create and manage your tokens. You can do it with the web page of your
Anaconda user or organization. In that page, the menu entrie 'Settings--> Access' shows the following form:

<br>
<center>
<img src="create_token.png" width="60%">
</center>
<br>

In this form mark the option 'Allow write access to the API site', choose a name and an expiration date
for your new token, and click 'Create'. Below this form, you will find the list of your tokens to
view their value or remove them.

Now, the last step. The repository where you want to include this GitHub Action has to have access,
quietly, to the value of this token. But you have to protect it, including the token string
explictly in the workflow is far from being a good idea. To solve this problem, GitHub includes for
your GitHub repositories or organizations, the possibility to store
['encrypted secrets'](https://github.blog/2021-04-13-implementing-least-privilege-for-secrets-in-github-actions/). [You can find documentation about it in the GitHub docs site](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets). Let's see here how to store the Anaconda token accesible for any public repository of an organization. Look for the section 'Settings -> Secrets' in the organization main web page in GitHub and click on the button 'New organization scret'. Briefly, choose a new name -this way for the variable storing the token value in GitHub- and copy the value of your token (a long string of "random" characters). As you can see in the secret creation form, you can give access to all public repositories in the organization or just a selected set of them (also to your private ones depending on your plan).

After all this process, **what matters to use this GitHub Action is the name of the secret with the
Anaconda token value**.

## How to use it

To include this GitHub Action, put a Yaml file (named 'build\_and\_upload\_conda\_packages.yaml', for instance) with the following content in the
directory '.github/workflows' of your repository:

```yaml

name: Build and upload conda packages

on:
  release:
    types: ['released', 'prereleased']

# workflow_dispatch:        # Un comment line if you also want to trigger action manually

jobs:
  conda_deployment_with_new_tag:
    name: Conda deployment of package to platform ${{ matrix.platform }} with Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.7, 3.8, 3.9]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Conda environment creation and activation
        uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2
        with:
          activate-environment: deployment
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
          channels: conda-forge, default
          auto-activate-base: false
          auto-update-conda: false
          show-channel-urls: true
      - name: Installing tools and dependencies in environment to build and upload conda packages
        shell: bash -l {0}
        run: |
          conda install -y anaconda-client conda-build
      - name: Build and upload the conda packages
        uses: uibcdf/action-build-and-upload-conda-packages@v1.0-beta.1
        with:
          meta_yaml_dir: devtools/conda-build
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }} # Values previously defined in `matrix`
          platform_linux-64: true
          platform_osx-64: true
          platform_win-64: true
          user: uibcdf
          label: auto
          token: ${{ secrets.ANACONDA_TOKEN }} # Replace with the right name of your secret
```


### Input parameters

These are the input parameters of the action:

| Input parameters | Description | Required | Default value | 
| ---------------- | ----------- | -------- | ------------- |
| meta\_yaml\_dir | Path to the directory where the meta.yaml file with building instructions is located  | Yes |  |
| python-version | Python version of the packages to build | Yes |  |
| platform\_all | Build packages for all supported platforms  | No | False |
| platform\_linux-64 | Build a package for the platform: linux-64 | No | False |
| platform\_linux-32 | Build a package for the platform: linux-32 | No | False |
| platform\_osx-64 | Build a package for the platform: osx-64 | No | False |
| platform\_arm-64 | Build a package for the platform: arm-64 | No | False |
| platform\_linux-ppc64 | Build a package for the platform: linux-ppc64 | No | False |
| platform\_linux-ppc64le | Build a package for the platform: linux-ppc64le | No | False |
| platform\_linux-s390x | Build a package for the platform: linux-s390x | No | False |
| platform\_linux-armv6l | Build a package for the platform: linux-armv6l | No | False |
| platform\_linux-armv7l | Build a package for the platform: linux-armv7l | No | False |
| platform\_linux-aarch64 | Build a package for the platform: linux-aarch64 | No | False |
| platform\_win-32 | Build a package for the platform: linux-win-32 | No | False |
| platform\_win-64 | Build a package for the platform: linux-win-64 | No | False |
| overwrite |  Do not cancel the uploading if a package with the same name is found already in Anaconda | No | False |
| user | User or organization name to upload packages to on anaconda.org | True |  |
| label | Name of the label to upload the package ('main', 'dev', ...). If the value is equal to 'auto', the action will automatically label releases as 'main' and prereleases as 'dev' | True | auto |
| token | Anaconda token to authorize the uploading (more info [here](#Anaconda-token-as-GitHub-secret)) | Yes |  |

They are placed in the `with:` subsection of the step named `Build and upload the conda packages` of the above workflow example file:

```yaml
      - name: Build and upload the conda packages
        uses: uibcdf/action-build-and-upload-conda-packages@v1.0
        with:
          meta_yaml_dir: devtools/conda-build
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }} # Values previously defined in `matrix`
          platform_linux-64: true
          platform_osx-64: true
          platform_win-64: true
          channel: uibcdf
          label: dev
          token: ${{ secrets.ANACONDA_TOKEN }}
```

At this point, you can probably wonder: but the python version of the package is specified in the
'meta.yaml' file, isn't it?

#### `python_version`

To define the python versions of the packages created by the GitHub Action you should use the input
parameter of [the workflow](#How-to-use-it) named `strategy: matrix: python-version`.

```yaml
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.7, 3.8, 3.9]
```

No matter the python version found in the 'meta.yaml' file, this action will make all the work to
convert the building instructions to the python versions you specify in your GitHub workflow.

## Other tools like this one

This GitHub Action was developed to solve a need of the [UIBCDF]((https://www.uibcdf.org/)). And to be used, additionally, as example of
house-made GitHub Action for researchers and students in this lab.

Other tools you can find in the market doing these same tasks are mentioned below. We recognize and
thank the work of their developers. Many of those GitHub Actions were used by us to learn how to set up our own one.

If you think that your GitHub Action should be mentioned here, fell free to PR with a new line.
